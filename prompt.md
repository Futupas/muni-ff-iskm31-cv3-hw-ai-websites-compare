You are a skilled frontend developer. You will architect, design and build a website

The website:

At the beginning there is a text input (arounf 100-500 chars max) with one of predefined phrases (like "a smell of petroleum prevails throughout". there should be like 10-20 such phrases with comments showing where this phrase is taken from). but user can enter its text, of course.

when user presses Enter or clicks "Go" button, the input dissapears, and the main part starts

Main part: 

Letters used in the string user has entered ("The Phrase") are apperaring all around the screen. they are all the different sizes and colors. they are different fonts. some of them are deformed (squezed, too bold, rotated, transformed etc). all of them has stroke same as body/html's background. they apperar in different places each second (or 2sec, this is a const value in JS). they not just randomly appear (however, thay can), but appear beautifully. the order is exactly like in The Phrase. when it's ended, it starts again from the forst letter infinitely. After some time the letters may or may not dissapear.

Inspire by popart letters, but with not so bright colors. the colors should be pleasant to human eye.

The website should run smoothly and be supported in all major platforms (desktop, mobile, windows, linux, macos)

Requirements:
* Website has both light and dark theme
* Website is adaptive for mobile devices
* Website is written in vanilla JS in strict mode ('use strict';)
* In JS you are using single quotes for strings (respect Pascal)
* Code should be readable and documented
* The website is in english
* Use your own CSS styles. No libraries allowed
* You can divide website into files. You can also not do it and keep a single index.html. Decide yourself
* Any needed graphics you do on your own using SVG
* NO external dependencies
* Website works without any backend, just in browser
* Use constants. No magic numbers or magic strings allowed. But use them wisely
* On the bottom of the website you specify on the website which model did it (write your name there. it should be visible for users)
* The title also contians which model generated this website

Also write me what did you do, and what did you decide to do when i told you there are more than one option
